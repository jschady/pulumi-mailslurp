NAME
  check-sdk-artifacts.sh - Checks the four SDK artifacts a release publishes.

SYNOPSIS
  $0 <directory> <version>

DESCRIPTION
  Reads the directory holding one restored SDK tree per language and fails when a
  language is missing its publishable artifact, when an artifact names another
  package, or when one was built at a different version. Run it before the release
  binaries publish: a release page carrying binaries that no SDK can be published
  against is a release nobody can consume.

  A path that merely exists proves nothing. Each staged artifact carries the name
  and the version it would publish under, and both are read here.

  <version> is the release tag. Each language spells a prerelease differently, so
  only the numeric part is compared.

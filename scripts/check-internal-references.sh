NAME
  check-internal-references.sh - Checks the tracked files for references to private build notes.

SYNOPSIS
  $0 [help]

DESCRIPTION
  This repository was built against planning documents that stay private. A comment or a
  message that cites one of them sends a reader to a document they cannot open.

  A tracked file states the reason itself, or it cites something public: an upstream issue
  URL, a file and line of a pinned public repository, or a vendor document.

  Add a name to ALLOWED only when a real word collides with one of the patterns.

NAME
  check-package-names.sh - Checks that the package names this repository publishes are free.

SYNOPSIS
  $0 [help]

DESCRIPTION
  Reads three package registries and fails when a name is already taken. Every
  request is a read. Run this immediately before the first publish: a name that
  was free when the release was prepared can be taken by the time it ships, and
  publishing under a name we do not hold gives the next version to whoever does.

  Nothing runs this automatically. Every name belongs to this repository once the
  first release publishes, so a scheduled run would fail from then on.

  The three URLs below are overridable so the decision this script makes about a
  status code can be exercised without reaching the real registries.
